# Privacy Policy

The CARMEN mobile app (for iOS and Android) operates by connecting to your own database server to store the data. As such, very minimal personal information is stored on your device, and no information whatsoever is sent to the authors of CARMEN during the use of the app.

A full description of how the data you enter into CARMEN is stored is provided below.

## Login details

If you tick the checkbox labelled "Save login details", all fields on the login screen (including password) will be stored locally to your device. These are not stored on any server, and are not accessible under any circumstance by the authors of CARMEN. Application settings may be backed up as part of your mobile operating system (iOS/Android) but that is up to the operating system to manage and store. The only time these login details leave your device in the CARMEN app is by using them to connect to the database server you have specified.

## Show and applicant details

The information you enter into CARMEN about the show you are working on, the items in the show, the roles in those items, and the people who you are auditioning for those roles is stored solely in the database server you specify when you login. You are solely responsible for providing and maintaining that database server, as CARMEN does not provide any servers to store this data. This personal information is not stored locally on your device, only on the database server you specify, except for applicant photos. To speed up viewing applicant photos, the first time you view each applicant's photo, it will be cached in a temporary folder provided by your device's operating system (iOS/Android).
